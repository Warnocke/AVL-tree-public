# AVL Tree Implementation in C++

This project implements an AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) self-balancing binary search tree in C++. It supports core operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and traversals, while maintaining balance through rotation logic.

# Features

- Insert, delete, and search nodes by unique ID (UFID)
- Pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals
- Remove a searched UFID
- Remove the N-th node in in-order sequence
- Height-balanced through AVL rotations
- Console-based user interface
- Unit tested with Catch2 framework

# Interface
Main is a small interface that can be used to demo the data structure, first enter how many arguments you wish to enter and then enter arguments in the form of 'insert "Steven Malkmus" 12345678'.

# Testing

This project includes unit tests written using the Catch 22 testing framework. To run the tests, make sure you switch to the testing configuration.
